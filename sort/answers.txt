sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 4.817s
sorted50,000 -> .427s

sort 1 was faster than sort 3 in sorting sorted50,000


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt - >.447s

for a reveresed text file of 50,000 numbers, it was exponentially faster
compared to the other sorting programs


sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: 

reveresed50,000.txt -> 2.489s
sorted50,000 -> 2.582s

it was the slowest sorting program in reveresed numeber text file, as well as a sorted
text file. hence we can conclude that this is a selection sort.
