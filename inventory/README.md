The command-line application developed in C is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline
and report fruit sales efficiently. User interaction begins with a prompt, telling them to
input the quantity of fruits sold for each type of fruit. Notably, the program
incorporates a robust check to ensure non-negativity and imposes a limit of 15 fruits per
input, aligning with the available inventory. This critical enhancement prevents users
from inadvertently exceeding inventory levels, contributing to more effective and accurate
inventory management.
Beyond the foundational features, the program integrates advanced functionalities, such as
the calculation of revenue and profit for each sale. Leveraging predefined fruit prices,
the application dynamically computes the revenue generated from sales and introduces a
cost assumption to derive profit figures. This comprehensive financial analysis enhances
the sales report, offering users valuable insights into the economic performance
associated with each fruit.
The culmination of these functionalities is presented through a meticulously crafted sales
report. This report not only showcases the remaining inventory for each fruit but also
provides a holistic overview, encompassing total sales, total revenue, and pinpointing the
highest and lowest selling products. The structured and insightful nature of the report
empowers users with swift access to critical sales performance metrics, facilitating
data-driven decision-making. The program's design and functionality reflect a harmonious
fusion of simplicity and practicality, underscoring its effectiveness as a robust
command-line tool for the meticulous management of fruit sales.
